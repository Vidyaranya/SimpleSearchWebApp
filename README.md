An easy way to run would be to open it in intellij or eclipse with tomcat support and just run tomcat from the IDE. Hit the following URL localhost:8080/untitled_war_exploded/Search  Make sure that the server you are using is also on 8080. Otherwise change to that corresponding port.

Improvements: I used a server side rendering here. However a better thing to do would be client side rendering using javascript.
